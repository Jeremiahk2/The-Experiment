Seline: Uhh sure. What was it that I needed to retrieve again?
do state.speaker_changed.emit("Eryndor")
Eryndor: Ahh yes, to start we will need The Tome of Conduits and a Griffin's Feather. I believe you should be able to find both items within the library.

Seline: Griffin's Feather and The Tome of Conduits. Sounds simple enough.

Eryndor: Fantastic! This will tell me all I need to know about the siphoning of magic and how to imbue such powerful into this ancient recreation.
Eyrndor: Now I will need two items that should be easily obtainable from the Alchemy classroom. Basilisks Venom and a Potion of Vitality.

Eryndor: Well done, and with that we are halfway complete with our little experiment. Only a few more items to collect and we will have ourselves one of the most powerful artifacts known to mankind.
do state.speaker_changed.emit("Seline")
Seline: Alright so what's next on the list?
do state.speaker_changed.emit("Eryndor")
Eryndor: Next we can either use a Blood Flower or a Royal Flower. Either should do so whichever is easier for you to find should work.
do state.speaker_changed.emit("Seline")
Seline: Those are two completely different ingredients with a vast difference in effect. Does it really not matter which we use?
do state.speaker_changed.emit("Eryndor")
Eryndor: Ahh Seline my dear this is why I am the scientist and you the assistant. Let me do the thinking and you the fetching. Now off you go.
do state.speaker_changed.emit("Seline")
